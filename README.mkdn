This is a hacky set of scripts to provide a webbased interface to my scanner.

This was thrown together in about 15-30 minutes, so don't expect anything special, I don't really expect it to work hugely well for anyone else.

Requirements:

- gocr
- tesseract
- imagemagick
- php
- linux

Optional:

- sane (to control local scanner. If a networked scanner is in use, just cron doOCR.sh or something.)
